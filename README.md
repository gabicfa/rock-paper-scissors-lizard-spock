# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic selection method in a play
of rock-paper-scissors. It operates under the same basic principle but includes two additional weapons: the lizard and the Spock. This way reduces the chances of ending in a
tie. Sam Kass and Karen Bryla invented the game.
